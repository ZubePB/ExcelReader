Excel Reader

Introduction:

Now that you have an initial foundation of C#, it’s time to tackle a very important task in programming.
The ability to work with files.When working in a company, all sorts of documents will be generated using a variety of file types:
.doc, .xls, .pdf, .csv, just to name a few of the most commonly used.

Your job as a programmer is to create applications that will manipulate data “to and from” these files.
In this project, we will transpose an excel table into an SQL database using a C# library.


Requirements:

- This is an application that will read data from an Excel spreadsheet into a database

- When the application starts, it should delete the database if it exists, create a new one, create all tables, read from Excel, seed into the database.

- You need to use EPPlus package

- You shouldn't read into Json first.

- You can use SQLite or SQL Server (or MySQL if you're using a Mac)

- Once the database is populated, you'll fetch data from it and show it in the console.

- You don't need any user input

- You should print messages to the console letting the user know what the app is doing at that moment (i.e. reading from excel; creating tables, etc)

- The application will be written for a known table, you don't need to make it dynamic.

- When submitting the project for review, you need to include an xls file that can be read by your application.
